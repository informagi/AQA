# AQA: Adaptive Question Answering in a Society of LLMs

In question answering (QA), different questions can be effectively addressed with different answering strategies. Some require a simple lookup, while others need complex, multi-step reasoning to be answered adequately. This observation motivates the development of a dynamic method that adaptively selects the most suitable QA strategy for each question, enabling more efficient and effective systems capable of addressing a broader range of question types. To this aim, we introduce ***AQA***, a novel adaptive question answering framework that uniquely frames the adaptive QA problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem, where the action space is a set of graph structures among LLM agents that describe their interactions. Thereby, the AQA framework dynamically orchestrates the collaboration of multiple agents in response to specific question characteristics.
