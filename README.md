# AQA: Adaptive Question Answering in a Society of LLMs
This is the repository for ***AQA***, a novel adaptive question answering framework that uniquely frames the adaptive QA problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem, where the action space is a set of graph structures among LLM agents that describe their interactions. Thereby, the AQA framework dynamically orchestrates the collaboration of multiple agents in response to specific question characteristics.
